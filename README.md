# Android Jetpack Demo  [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/jumaallan/android-jetpack.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/jumaallan/android-jetpack)

This is a sample repo to show how to use the Android Jetpack announced in the Google I/O 2018 for android254 Meetup, at iHub Nairobi.

The app uses the **MVVM Architecture**. I have used the following components for development:

* Room - For offline data persistence
* LiveData - Handle data in a lifecycle-aware fashion 
* ViewModel - Manage your UI's data in a lifecycle-aware fashion
* DataBinding -  minimize the glue code necessary to bind your application logic and layouts.
